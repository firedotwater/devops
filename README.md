## About the course :writing_hand:
Hey there! I'm Fabio, the one and only. Mostly, we're forming relationships with AWS and learning how it works. Secondly, we can contribute to the AWS Academy Cloud Foundations. This kind of course would prepare us for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam. We are also doing some nice things with the [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/firedotwater) environment.

## Why doing this? :computer:
We are using the repo like as an daily journal, what we exactly did and what we got and what we didn't understood. It is in other words, a journal of our process. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
