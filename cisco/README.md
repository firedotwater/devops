This is the real question all of them.

Answer to this question:
```
there is no wrong or right, we developer know exactly what we are talking about, right?
```

## What does it exactly :question:

CPT is an excellent piece of software for both experienced and inexperienced network administrators. It can do basically everything, like building the complete infrastructure of a firm and testing their network rules, for example, with a firewall or a switch. CPT is often used in schools to test their students in a specific area, such as port forwarding or blocking other things.


## Do I actually use it :sleeping: ?

Well to be honest I never did actually liked Cisco the Packettracer because it has still the same Ui from +10 years ago. And that's why I never used it on purpes. But after I got mature I learned, I should not look only on the outside look. Now I still dont't like but it haves very nice tools to investigate for network troubles. But also to be honest it can be very quickly **heavly** complicated and complex.
