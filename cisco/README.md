This is the real question all of them.

Answer to this question:
```
there is no wrong or right, we developer know exactly what we are talking about, right?
```

## What does it exactly :question:

CPT is an excellent piece of software for both experienced and inexperienced network administrators. It can do basically everything, like building the complete infrastructure of a firm and testing their network rules, for example, with a firewall or a switch. CPT is often used in schools to test their students in a specific area, such as port forwarding or blocking other things.


## Do I actually use it :sleeping: ?

To be honest, I never liked Cisco's PacketTracer because it still has the same user interface as it did ten years ago. And that's why I never used it on purpose. But as I grew older, I realized that I shouldn't focus solely on the outside. Now I still don't like it, but it has very nice tools to investigate network troubles. But, to be honest, it can quickly become **very** complicated and complex.
